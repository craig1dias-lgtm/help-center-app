# Missing Items from Your Order? Resolution Guide

If you've received your MatchMint order and noticed that some items are missing, we understand this can be frustrating. We're here to help resolve this issue quickly and ensure you receive all the items you ordered.

## Verify Your Order Contents

First, please check your order confirmation email to confirm what should have been included:

1. Locate your order confirmation email from support@matchmint.com
2. Check the "Order Details" section for a complete list of items
3. Compare this with the items you received
4. Check all packaging materials thoroughly (small items might be inside packaging)
5. Look for packing slips that list the contents of each package

## Common Missing Item Scenarios

Several situations might result in incomplete orders:

1. **Split shipments**: Large orders may ship in multiple packages
2. **Packaging errors**: Items may have been left out during packing
3. **Lost during shipping**: Items may have been separated during transit
4. **Hidden items**: Small items might be inside packaging materials
5. **Partial fulfillment**: Some items might be shipping separately due to availability
