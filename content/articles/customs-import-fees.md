# Customs & Import Fees

When ordering from MatchMint to an international destination, you may be subject to import duties and taxes which are levied once the package reaches your country. These charges are the responsibility of the recipient.

## Understanding Customs Duties & Import Taxes

Customs duties and import taxes are fees imposed by your country's government on goods entering from abroad. These fees:

- Are **not** included in our product prices or shipping costs
- Vary widely from country to country
- Are typically based on the declared value of the items
- May include VAT (Value Added Tax), GST (Goods and Services Tax), or other local taxes

## Estimated Fees by Region

While we cannot provide exact amounts as they vary by country and order value, here are some general estimates:

| Region | Typical Fee Range | Tax Type |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| European Union | 15-25% of order value | VAT + Customs |
| United Kingdom | 20% + handling fee | VAT + Customs |
| Canada | 5-13% + handling fee | GST/HST + Customs |
| Australia | 10% for orders over AUD 1000 | GST + Customs |
| Brazil | Up to 60% of order value | Import Tax |
| Japan | 8-10% of order value | Consumption Tax |

## How Customs Processing Works

1. Your MatchMint order is shipped from our facility
2. The package arrives at your country's customs authority
3. Customs officials assess the package and determine applicable fees
4. If fees are due, the delivery carrier will collect payment before delivery
5. Once payment is made, the package is released for final delivery

## Payment Methods for Customs Fees

Customs fees are typically collected by the delivery carrier using these methods:

- Direct payment to the delivery person upon delivery
- Online payment through the carrier's website using the tracking number
- Payment at a local post office or carrier facility before pickup

## Calculating Potential Import Fees

While exact calculations vary by country, you can estimate potential fees using:

- **Product Value**: The total cost of your order (excluding shipping)
- **Local Tax Rate**: Your country's VAT, GST, or sales tax percentage
- **Duty Rate**: Depends on product category and country agreements
- **Handling Fee**: Administrative charge from the carrier (typically $10-20)

Some countries offer online import duty calculators on their customs websites.

## Tips to Avoid Customs Delays

To minimize customs delays:

- Ensure your delivery address is complete and accurate
- Be available to pay customs fees promptly when notified
- Keep your contact information up to date for carrier notifications
- Check your country's specific import restrictions before ordering
- Respond quickly to any customs documentation requests

Unfortunately, we cannot pre-pay customs fees as they're determined and collected by your local authorities.
