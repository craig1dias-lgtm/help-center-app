# Order Not Shipped Yet? Shipping Status Guide

If you're waiting for your MatchMint order to ship and are concerned about delays, this guide will help you understand our shipping process, timeframes, and what to do if your order seems delayed.

## Understanding Our Processing Timeline

Before an order ships, it goes through several stages:

1. **Order Confirmation** (Immediate)
   - You receive an email confirming your order was placed successfully

2. **Design & Production** (3-5 business days)
   - Your custom sports card is designed and produced
   - This may take longer during busy periods

3. **Quality Control** (1 business day)
   - Each card is inspected to ensure it meets our standards

4. **Packaging & Shipping** (1 business day)
   - Your order is carefully packaged and handed to our shipping partner
   - You receive a shipping confirmation email with tracking information

## Expected Processing Timeframes

| Order Type | Standard Processing | Super Fast Track |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Standard Orders | 5-7 business days | 2-3 business days |
| Complex Custom Orders | 7-10 business days | 3-5 business days |
| Team Sets | 8-12 business days | 4-6 business days |

> **Note:** Business days do not include weekends or holidays.

## How to Check Your Order Status

### 1. Check Your Email
- Look for order confirmation and shipping notification emails
