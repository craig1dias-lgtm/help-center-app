# Label Created But No Updates? Tracking Status Explained

It can be concerning when your tracking information shows only "Label Created" or "Pre-Transit" for several days without any updates. This is actually a common occurrence in shipping, especially during busy periods. Here's what this status means and why it might not be updating.

## What "Label Created" Status Actually Means

When you see "Label Created," "Shipping Label Created," or "Pre-Transit" status, it indicates:

- A shipping label has been generated for your order
- The tracking number has been created in the carrier's system
- The package has not yet received its first scan at a carrier facility

This status **does not** necessarily mean your package isn't moving. It simply means the package hasn't been scanned yet.

## Common Reasons for Extended "Label Created" Status

### 1. Pickup Schedule Gaps
- We may create shipping labels in batches, but carrier pickups occur on a set schedule
- Labels created after the day's pickup will show this status until the next pickup
- Weekend and holiday gaps can extend this period

### 2. First Scan Delays
- Some carriers don't scan packages until they reach a major sorting facility
- The package may be in transit for 1-3 days before receiving its first scan
- This is especially common during high-volume periods (holidays, sales events)

### 3. Carrier System Delays
- Sometimes packages are scanned, but the information isn't updated in the tracking system
- System delays can cause tracking to appear static even when the package is moving
- These technical delays usually resolve within 24-48 hours

### 4. Regional Processing Differences
- Different regions and facilities have varying scanning procedures
- Some facilities scan every package at intake, while others only scan at major sorting points
- Rural areas often have less frequent scanning than urban centers

## Expected Timeframes by Shipping Method

| Shipping Method | Normal Period | High-Volume Period | When to Contact Us |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| USPS First Class | 1-2 business days | 2-4 business days | After 5 business days |
| USPS Priority | 1-2 business days | 2-3 business days | After 4 business days |
| FedEx Ground | 1-2 business days | 2-4 business days | After 5 business days |
| FedEx Express | 1 business day | 1-2 business days | After 3 business days |
| International | 2-3 business days | 3-5 business days | After 7 business days |

## Carrier-Specific Information

### USPS
- "Pre-Transit" status is common and can last several days
- First scan often doesn't occur until the package reaches a regional distribution center
- Weekend and holiday processing is limited, extending "Pre-Transit" periods
- USPS Ground Advantage and First Class packages typically experience longer pre-transit periods

### FedEx
- "Label Created" or "Shipment information sent to FedEx" status
- FedEx typically scans packages at pickup, but may batch update systems
- Ground shipments may show this status longer than Express shipments
- Rural areas may experience longer delays between scans

### DHL
- "Shipment information received" is their version of label created
- International shipments often show this status until clearing customs
- First scan typically occurs at the regional processing center

## The Journey From Label to Delivery

Understanding the full shipping process helps explain the "Label Created" status:

1. **Order Processing**: Your order is prepared for shipping
2. **Label Generation**: We create a shipping label and assign a tracking number
3. **Packaging**: Your order is packaged and placed in the outgoing shipment area
4. **Carrier Pickup**: The carrier collects packages from our facility (scheduled times)
5. **First Scan**: Package receives its first scan either at pickup or at the first facility
6. **Regular Updates**: Normal tracking updates begin after this first scan
7. **Final Delivery**: Package is delivered to your address

### Within the normal timeframes:
- Be patient - this is a normal part of the shipping process

- Check the carrier's service alerts for any regional delays
