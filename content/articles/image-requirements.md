# Image Requirements & Photo Guidelines

To ensure the best quality for your custom sports cards, please follow these image guidelines. The right photo makes all the difference in creating a professional-looking card.

## Technical Image Specifications

| Specification | Requirement | Recommendation |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Resolution | Minimum 1000 x 1000 pixels | 1500 x 2000 pixels or higher |
| Format | JPG, PNG, or HEIC | JPG for photos, PNG for graphics |
| File Size | Maximum 10MB | 2-5MB for optimal balance |
| Aspect Ratio | 3:4 portrait orientation | Full body or waist-up shots |
| Color Profile | RGB | sRGB preferred |

## Photo Quality Guidelines

For the best results, your photos should have:

- **Good lighting**: Well-lit subjects with minimal shadows
- **Clear focus**: Sharp, non-blurry images
- **Minimal background**: Simple backgrounds work best with our removal tool
- **Subject positioning**: Center the person in the frame
- **Face visibility**: Ensure the face is clearly visible
- **Appropriate distance**: Not too close or too far from subject

## Visual Examples

### Good Examples:
- Professional sports photos
- Team photos in uniform
- Portrait photos with clear lighting
- Action shots where face is visible
- Photos against plain backgrounds

### Poor Examples:
- Blurry or pixelated images
- Very dark or overexposed photos
- Images with multiple people (unless ordering a team card)
- Very small file sizes (under 500KB)
- Screenshots from social media (these are usually compressed)

## Background Removal Information

Our system automatically removes backgrounds from your images. For best results:

- Choose photos with good contrast between the subject and background
- Avoid photos where clothing blends into the background
- Photos taken against solid-colored backgrounds work best
- Ensure the subject has clear, defined edges
- Avoid complex backgrounds with similar colors to the subject

## Device-Specific Tips

### Mobile Phone Photos
- Clean your camera lens before taking photos
- Use natural daylight when possible
- Hold steady or use a tripod for sharpness
- Use portrait mode if available
- Avoid using digital zoom (move closer instead)

### DSLR/Professional Camera
- Use aperture priority mode (f/4-f/8) for good depth of field
- Set ISO to 400 or lower for minimal noise
- Use a focal length of 50-85mm for portraits
- RAW format photos should be converted to JPG before uploading

## Special Case Guidelines

### Team Cards
For team cards with multiple players:
- Ensure all players are clearly visible
- Try to have consistent lighting across all players
- Position players in a standard team formation
- Maintain similar distance for all subjects

### Action Shots
If using action shots:
- Choose moments where the player's face is visible
- Avoid extreme motion blur
- Select images where the player is the clear focus
- Higher shutter speeds (1/500s or faster) produce better results

## Troubleshooting Upload Issues

If you're having trouble uploading your image:
- Try reducing the file size (but keep it above 1MB if possible)
- Convert to JPG format if using another format
- Clear your browser cache and try again
- Use a different browser or device
- Check our [Android Upload Issue](android-upload-image-issue) guide for mobile-specific help
