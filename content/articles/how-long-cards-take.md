# How long do cards take to make?

At MatchMint, we pride ourselves on delivering high-quality custom sports cards in a timely manner. Here's what you can expect regarding our production timeframes:

## Standard Production Times

Our standard production time for custom sports cards is **3-5 business days**. This includes:

- Processing your order
- Creating your custom design
- Printing and quality checking
- Packaging for shipment

## Factors That May Affect Production Time

Several factors can influence how quickly we can produce your cards:

### Order Volume
During peak seasons (holidays, major sporting events, etc.), we may experience higher order volumes which could extend production times slightly.

### Design Complexity
Cards with complex customizations or special requests might take additional time to perfect.

### Image Quality
If we need to request a replacement image due to quality issues, this may add time to the process.

## Expedited Options

Need your cards faster? We offer expedited production options:

### Super Fast Track
Our Super Fast Track service prioritizes your order in our production queue, reducing the production time to **1-2 business days**. This service is available for an additional fee during checkout.

> **Note:** Expedited production does not include expedited shipping. Shipping times depend on your location and selected shipping method.

## Production Status Updates

You'll receive email notifications at key stages of the production process:

1. When your order is received
2. When your design is approved and moves to production
3. When your order has been completed and shipped
