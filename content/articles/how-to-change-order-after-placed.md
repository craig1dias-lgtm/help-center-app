# How to Change Your Order After Placement

We understand that sometimes you may need to make changes to your order after it's been placed. Here's how you can request modifications to your MatchMint order:

## Order Modification Timeframes

**Important:** The ability to make changes depends on how far along your order is in our production process. Once an order enters production, some changes may no longer be possible.

| Order Status | Change Flexibility | Response Time |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Just Placed (0-2 hours) | Very High | Immediate |
| Processing (not in production) | High | Within 24 hours |
| In Production | Limited | Within 24 hours |
| Completed/Shipped | Very Limited | Within 24 hours |

## Types of Changes You Can Request

### Before Production Begins
If your order hasn't entered production yet, we can typically accommodate these changes:

- Player name, number, or position
- Card design or card type
- Image replacement
- Shipping address updates
- Adding or removing items from your order
- Cancellation (full refund available)

### During Production
Once production has started but isn't complete, we may be able to make limited changes:

- Shipping address updates
- Shipping method changes (may incur additional fees)
- Limited design changes (case-by-case basis)

### After Production is Complete
Once your order has been produced, changes are very limited:

- Shipping address updates (if not yet dispatched)
- Shipping method upgrades (additional fees apply)

## Expediting Changed Orders

If your change request delays your order and you need it quickly:

1. Request our Super Fast Track service when making your change request
2. Additional fees will apply for expedited processing
3. We'll prioritize your modified order to minimize delays

## Order Change Policy

- All change requests are subject to review and may be declined if they cannot be accommodated
- We cannot guarantee that all change requests will be fulfilled, especially for orders already in production
- Multiple change requests for the same order may result in significant delays
- Change requests submitted after 2 PM may not be processed until the next business day

We strive to be as accommodating as possible with change requests while maintaining our production efficiency and quality standards. Please contact us as soon as you know you need a change to give us the best chance of fulfilling your request.
