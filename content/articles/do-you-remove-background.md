# Do you remove the background on my picture?

## Yes, we remove the background on all custom card images!

At MatchMint, we professionally remove the background from every image used on our custom sports cards. This is a standard part of our service and is included at no extra cost.

## Why we remove backgrounds

Background removal is essential for creating authentic-looking sports cards that match the style of professional trading cards. By isolating the subject (player) from the original background, we can:

1. Create a clean, professional look
2. Properly position the player on the card template
3. Ensure consistency with professional card aesthetics
4. Apply special effects and highlights around the player

## Our background removal process

Our design team uses professional photo editing techniques to:

1. Carefully trace around the subject
2. Remove the original background
3. Create clean edges around hair, clothing, and equipment
4. Position the subject optimally on the card template
5. Add appropriate shadows and highlights if needed

## Tips for easier background removal

While we can work with most images, these tips will help us achieve the best results:

- **High contrast**: Images where the subject stands out clearly from the background
- **Clear edges**: Avoid images where the subject blends into the background
- **Good lighting**: Well-lit photos make edge detection easier
- **Solid backgrounds**: Simple backgrounds are easier to remove cleanly

## Special cases

### Complex backgrounds
For images with very complex backgrounds (like crowds or busy scenes), our designers will take extra care to ensure clean edges around the subject.

### Multiple subjects
If your image contains multiple people and you want only one on your card, please indicate clearly which person should be featured.

### Already removed backgrounds
If you've already removed the background from your image, that's fine! We'll still check the edges and make any necessary adjustments.

## Quality assurance

Every image undergoes quality control checks to ensure the background removal looks natural and professional before your card is printed.

If you have any specific concerns about background removal for your particular image, please include a note with your order or contact our customer service team.
