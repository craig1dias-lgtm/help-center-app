# How to Change Your Delivery Address

If you need to change the delivery address for your MatchMint order, your options depend on the current status of your order. Here's what you need to know:

## Before Your Order Ships

If your order hasn't shipped yet (status is "Processing" or "In Production"), you can request an address change:

### 1. Contact Us Immediately
- **Email**: support@matchmint.com with subject line "Address Change Request - Order #[Your Order Number]"
- **Contact Form**: Use the [Contact Form](contact-us) on our website
- **Response Time**: Typically within 24 hours

### 2. Information to Include
- Your full name
- Order number
- Original delivery address
- New delivery address (complete with street, city, state/province, postal code, and country)
- Contact phone number

### 3. What Happens Next
- Our team will confirm if the address change is possible
- If confirmed, we'll update your order details
- You'll receive a confirmation email once the change is made

## After Your Order Ships

If your order has already shipped, the options are more limited but may still be possible:

### For USPS Shipments
- **Package Intercept**: We can request a USPS Package Intercept for an additional fee
- **Change of Address**: If you've filed a change of address with USPS, your package may be forwarded
- **Hold for Pickup**: We may be able to reroute to a local post office for pickup

### For FedEx Shipments
- **Delivery Manager**: You may be able to redirect through FedEx Delivery Manager
- **Hold at Location**: We can request the package be held at a FedEx location for pickup
- **Address Correction**: Available in some cases for an additional fee

### For DHL Shipments
- **On-Demand Delivery**: You may be able to redirect through DHL On-Demand Delivery
- **Service Point Redirect**: We can request delivery to a DHL Service Point

## Address Change Timeframes

| Order Status | Address Change Possibility | Response Time |
|--------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| Processing | Very likely | Within 24 hours |
| In Production | Likely | Within 24 hours |
| Shipped (within 24 hours) | Possible with fees | 1-2 business days |
| In Transit | Limited options | 1-2 business days |
| Out for Delivery | Very unlikely | Same day |

## Additional Fees

Please note that address changes after shipping may incur additional fees:

- USPS Package Intercept: $15.25 + possible postage rate changes
- FedEx Address Correction: $17.50
- DHL Address Change: Varies by country

## If Address Change Is Not Possible

If we cannot change your delivery address:

1. The package will likely be delivered to the original address
2. If undeliverable, it will be returned to us
3. Once returned, we can resend to the correct address (additional shipping fees apply)
4. In some cases, you may be able to contact the current residents to retrieve your package

## International Orders & Address Changes

For international orders, address changes after shipping are extremely difficult due to customs documentation. If your international order has shipped with incorrect address information:

- Contact us immediately
- We may need to wait for the package to be returned
- Additional customs forms may be required
- Significant delays may occur

## Preventing Address Issues

To avoid delivery address problems:

- Double-check your shipping address during checkout
- Ensure apartment/unit numbers are included
- Verify postal/zip codes are correct
- Consider shipping to an address where someone is regularly available
- Update your default address in your account settings

If you need to change your delivery address or have questions about your options:

- **Email**: support@matchmint.com
- **Subject**: "Address Change - Order #[Your Order Number]"
- **Response Time**: Within 24 hours (1 hour for urgent cases)
