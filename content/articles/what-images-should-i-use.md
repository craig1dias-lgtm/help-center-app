# What images should I use for my order? Soccer/Football Photo Guide

Choosing the right image for your custom sports card is crucial for creating a professional, authentic-looking result. Follow these guidelines to ensure your card looks its best:

## Ideal Image Characteristics

### Image Quality
- **High resolution**: At least 1000px in height/width
- **Clear and sharp**: Avoid blurry or pixelated images
- **Good lighting**: Well-lit photos show more detail

### Subject Positioning
- **Full body or waist-up shots**: These work best for sports cards
- **Subject facing forward or at a slight angle**: Similar to professional sports cards
- **Player in action**: Action shots in a football/soccer context look most authentic

### Background
- **Simple backgrounds**: These are easier to work with
- **Contrasting background**: Your subject should stand out clearly
- **Sports context**: On the pitch, in a stadium, or in team gear

## Examples of Good Images

1. **Professional match photos**: Players in action during a match
2. **Team photos**: Official team photos with players in uniform
3. **Training session photos**: Clear shots of players in training gear
4. **Amateur match photos**: As long as they're clear and well-lit

## Images to Avoid

- ❌ **Low resolution/small images**: These will look pixelated when enlarged
- ❌ **Group photos where the subject is small**: We'll need to crop significantly
- ❌ **Heavy filters or effects**: These reduce image quality
- ❌ **Screenshots from social media**: These are typically compressed and low quality
- ❌ **Images with text overlays**: These interfere with the card design

## Tips for Taking Your Own Photos

If you're taking photos specifically for your custom card:

1. **Use natural light**: Shoot outdoors or near windows for best lighting
2. **Use a plain background**: A solid color wall or sports field works well
3. **Wear appropriate attire**: Sports kit or training gear looks most authentic
4. **Capture action poses**: Dribbling, shooting, or celebrating goals
5. **Take multiple shots**: This gives us options to choose from

## Image Editing

- Remove backgrounds when necessary

1. Email it to our support team before ordering
2. Include multiple image options with your order
3. Note any specific preferences in the order comments

Remember, the better your starting image, the better your final card will look!
