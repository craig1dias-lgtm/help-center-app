# Received Wrong Cards? Resolution Guide

If you've opened your MatchMint package and discovered that you received incorrect cards, we sincerely apologize for this error. We understand how disappointing this can be, especially if you were looking forward to your custom sports cards for a special occasion. We're committed to resolving this issue as quickly as possible.

## Types of "Wrong Card" Issues

There are several ways an order might be incorrect:

1. **Wrong player/person**: The cards feature someone other than who you ordered
2. **Wrong design**: You received a different card design than what you selected
3. **Wrong details**: Incorrect name, number, position, or stats on your cards
4. **Wrong team**: Incorrect team logo or colors
5. **Mixed-up order**: You received someone else's order entirely

## Immediate Steps to Take

### 1. Document the Error

- Take clear photos of the cards you received
