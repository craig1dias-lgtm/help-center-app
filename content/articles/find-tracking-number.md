# How to Find Your Tracking Number

Your tracking number is the key to monitoring your MatchMint order's journey from our facility to your doorstep. Here's how to locate it:

## Finding Your Tracking Number in Shipping Confirmation Email

The easiest way to find your tracking number is in your shipping confirmation email:

1. Check your email inbox for a message from MatchMint with the subject line "Your MatchMint Order Has Shipped"
2. Open the email
3. Look for a section labeled "Tracking Information" or "Shipping Details"
4. Your tracking number will be displayed as a series of numbers and letters
5. In most emails, the tracking number is also a clickable link that takes you directly to the carrier's tracking page

## Finding Your Tracking Number in Your MatchMint Account

You can also find your tracking number by logging into your account:

1. Go to the MatchMint website and log in to your account
2. Navigate to "My Orders" or "Order History"
3. Find the order you want to track and click on "View Order Details"
4. Scroll down to the "Shipping Information" section
5. Your tracking number will be displayed here, along with the shipping carrier

## Identifying Your Tracking Number Format

Different carriers use different tracking number formats:

| Carrier | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| USPS | 22 digits, usually starts with 9 | 9400 1000 0000 0000 0000 00 |
| FedEx | 12 or 15 digits | 1234 5678 9012 |
| DHL | 10 digits | 1234567890 |
| Royal Mail | 13 characters | AB123456789GB |
| UPS | 18 characters | 1Z 999 AA1 01 2345 6784 |

## Tracking Your Package

Once you have your tracking number, you can track your package by:

1. **Carrier Website**: Visit the shipping carrier's website and enter your tracking number
2. **Direct Links**: Click the tracking link in your shipping confirmation email
3. **MatchMint Account**: Track directly through your order details page
4. **Carrier App**: Download the carrier's mobile app for real-time updates

## What If I Can't Find My Tracking Number?

If you've checked your email and account but still can't find your tracking number:

1. Check your spam or junk folder for the shipping confirmation email
2. Look for any emails from USPS, FedEx, or DHL (sometimes they send tracking updates directly)
3. Wait 24-48 hours after receiving your order confirmation (there's a short delay between order confirmation and shipping)
4. Search your email for "MatchMint shipped" or "order shipped"
5. Check if you received a text message with tracking information (if you provided a mobile number)

## Common Questions About Tracking Numbers

### When will I receive my tracking number?
You'll receive your tracking number via email once your order has been shipped, typically 1-3 business days after your order is placed (depending on production time).

### My tracking number isn't working. What should I do?
If your tracking number isn't recognized when you try to track it, please wait 24 hours and try again. Sometimes there's a delay between when the label is created and when the carrier's system recognizes it.

### I received a tracking number, but it shows "Label Created" only. Why?
This status means the shipping label has been created, but the package hasn't been picked up by the carrier yet or hasn't had its first scan. Please see our article on [tracking information not updating](tracking-not-updating) for more details.

### Can I get tracking updates via text message?
Yes, most carriers offer text message alerts. Once you have your tracking number, you can sign up for text notifications directly on the carrier's website.
