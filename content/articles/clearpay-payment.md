# Clearpay/Afterpay Payment Guide

## What is Clearpay?

Clearpay (known as Afterpay in some regions) is a "buy now, pay later" service that allows you to split your MatchMint purchase into four equal installments, paid over six weeks, with no interest or additional fees when you pay on time. This payment option gives you the flexibility to get your custom sports cards immediately while spreading the cost over time.

> **Note:** Clearpay is called Afterpay in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. The service works the same way regardless of the name.

## How Clearpay Works

When you choose Clearpay at checkout, here's what happens:

1. **First payment**: Pay 25% of the total purchase amount upfront
2. **Remaining payments**: Three more equal payments of 25% each, automatically charged every two weeks
3. **Complete payment**: Your order is fully paid after six weeks

### Payment Schedule Example

| Purchase Total | Today | In 2 Weeks | In 4 Weeks | In 6 Weeks |
|----------------|-------|------------|------------|------------|
| £100 | £25 | £25 | £25 | £25 |
| £200 | £50 | £50 | £50 | £50 |
| £400 | £100 | £100 | £100 | £100 |
