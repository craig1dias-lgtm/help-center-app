# Finding Club or Nationality Badges

If you're having trouble finding a specific club or nationality badge while creating your custom sports card, we understand this can be frustrating. Here's what you need to know and how to proceed.

## Why Some Badges May Not Be Available

There are several reasons why certain club or nationality badges might not appear in our selection:

### Licensing Restrictions

- Some clubs and national teams have **exclusive licensing agreements** that restrict the use of their official badges
- We can only offer badges for which we have proper licensing or those that fall under fair use

### Recent Changes to Clubs/Nations

- **Newly formed clubs** may not be in our database yet
- **Rebranded clubs** with new logos might not be updated in our system
- **New national teams** or those with recent flag changes might be missing

### Search Functionality Limitations

- Our search function may not recognize **alternative spellings or names**
- Some badges might be categorized differently than expected

## How to Find the Badge You're Looking For

### Search Tips

1. **Try different search terms**:
   - Search by country first, then narrow down to clubs
   - Try the city name instead of the club name
   - Try abbreviations (e.g., "PSG" instead of "Paris Saint-Germain")

2. **Check different categories**:
   - Some badges might be in "Classic Teams" or "Rest of World" categories
   - National badges are separate from club badges

3. **Browse instead of search**:
   - Sometimes browsing through categories is more effective than searching
   - Check under regional categories (Europe, South America, etc.)

## Alternative Solutions

If you still can't find the badge you're looking for, we offer these alternatives:

### Generic Options

- We provide **generic badge templates** that can be customized with colors similar to your desired club
- **Letter badges** can be used with the initial of your club or country
- **Star badges** and other neutral designs are available as alternatives

### Custom Badge Upload (If Available)

Some of our card types allow you to upload a custom badge:

1. Find an appropriate image of the badge online
2. Ensure it has a transparent background (PNG format)
3. The image should be at least 200x200 pixels for good quality
4. Use the custom upload option in the card designer

> **Note:** Custom uploaded badges must not violate copyright laws. Use only badges you have rights to use or that are available under fair use.

## Request a Badge Addition

We regularly update our badge collection based on customer requests:

1. **Email us** at support@matchmint.com
2. **Subject line**: "Badge Request - [Club/Country Name]"
3. **Include**:
   - The exact name of the club or country
   - A reference image if possible
   - Why this badge is important to you

We'll evaluate all requests and add badges when possible, considering licensing restrictions and demand.

## Creating Cards Without Official Badges

If you can't find your preferred badge and need to proceed with your order:

- Consider using a **similar-looking badge** from another club/country
- Use a **generic badge** that matches the color scheme
- Choose a **custom design** that represents the team spirit without using the official logo
- Focus on making the **player image and card design** the highlight instead of the badge
