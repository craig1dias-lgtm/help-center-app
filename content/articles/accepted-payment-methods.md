These services allow you to split your payment into installments. Terms and eligibility vary by provider and region.

## Bank Transfers

In select regions, we also accept direct bank transfers:

- ACH (US)

- BACS (UK)

Please note that orders paid via bank transfer will only be processed once payment has been confirmed, which may take 1-3 business days.

You can use MatchMint gift cards and store credit for all or part of your purchase. Simply enter your gift card code or apply your store credit during checkout.

## Business & Institutional Payments

For bulk orders or business purchases, we also accept:

- Purchase orders (for approved accounts)

Please contact our business sales team at business@matchmint.com for more information on these payment options.

## Currency & International Payments

We process payments in several currencies:

- US Dollars (USD)
- British Pounds (GBP)
- Euros (EUR)
- Canadian Dollars (CAD)
- Australian Dollars (AUD)

Our system will automatically display prices in your local currency where available. If your local currency is not supported, your order will be processed in USD and your bank may apply conversion fees.

## Payment Security Measures

All payment information is encrypted using industry-standard SSL technology. We implement multiple security measures:

- PCI DSS compliance for all transactions
- 3D Secure authentication where available
- Address Verification System (AVS) checks
- Card Verification Value (CVV) validation
- Fraud monitoring systems

We never store your full credit card details on our servers.

## Troubleshooting Payment Issues

If you experience any issues with payment:

1. Check that your payment details are entered correctly
2. Verify that your payment method has sufficient funds
3. Ensure your billing address matches the address on file with your payment provider
4. Try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser
5. Try an alternative payment method

## Changing Payment Methods

Once an order has been placed, the payment method cannot be changed. If you need to use a different payment method, you'll need to cancel the original order (if possible) and place a new one.
