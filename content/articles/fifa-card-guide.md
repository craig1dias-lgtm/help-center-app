# Custom Sports Card Creation Guide

Our custom sports card builder allows you to create personalized player cards that look professional and authentic. Follow this step-by-step guide to create your perfect card.

## Step 1: Basic Information

Start by entering the player's name and uploading a photo. For best results:

- Use a clear, high-quality image
- Choose a photo where the player is facing forward
- Make sure the player's face is clearly visible
- Select the player's position from the dropdown menu
- Enter the player's number if desired

Our system will automatically remove the background from your image. For more detailed photo guidelines, see our [Image Requirements](image-requirements) article.

## Step 2: Choose Club & Country

Select the club and country for your player card. You can search from our extensive database of:

- Over 700 club teams

Can't find your team? Use our search function or browse by league/region. If your team isn't listed, you can request to have it added by contacting our support team.
