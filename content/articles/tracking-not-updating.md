# Tracking Not Updating? Troubleshooting Guide

It can be concerning when your tracking information doesn't update for several days. Here's what you need to know and what you can do if your MatchMint order's tracking seems to be stuck.

## Common Reasons for Tracking Delays

### 1. Initial Processing Period
- After a shipping label is created, there can be a 1-3 day gap before the first scan
- Status may remain as "Label Created" or "Pre-Transit" during this time
- This is normal and doesn't indicate a problem with your order

### 2. Carrier Scanning Gaps
- Packages aren't scanned at every point in their journey
- Carriers sometimes miss scanning packages at certain facilities
- Your package may still be moving even without tracking updates

### 3. High Volume Periods
- During holidays or sales events, carriers handle increased volume
- Tracking updates may be delayed or less frequent
- Delivery may still occur on schedule despite fewer updates

### 4. International Shipping Factors
- Customs processing can cause delays of 3-10 days with no updates
- Different countries have varying levels of tracking detail
- Handoffs between carriers can create gaps in tracking information

### 5. Weather and Logistical Issues
- Severe weather can delay both deliveries and tracking updates
- Logistical issues at distribution centers may cause temporary delays
- System outages can affect tracking information updates

## Troubleshooting Steps by Timeframe

### If It's Been Less Than 3 Business Days Since Label Creation:
- **Be patient** - This is normal processing time
- **Check the carrier's website directly** rather than using links
- **Verify your email address** is correct to ensure you receive updates

### If It's Been 3-5 Business Days With No Updates:
- **Contact the shipping carrier** directly with your tracking number
- **Check if there are known delays** in your area or at the destination
- **Verify your delivery address** is correct in your order details

### If It's Been More Than 5 Business Days With No Updates:
- Contact our support team with your order number and tracking information
- We can file a trace with the shipping carrier
- We may be able to provide additional information not shown in the public tracking

## Understanding Common Tracking Statuses

### "Label Created" or "Pre-Transit" Status

This status means:
- The shipping label has been generated
- The package has not yet been picked up by the carrier
- Or the package has been picked up but hasn't received its first scan

This status can remain unchanged for:
- 1-2 business days for domestic shipments
- 2-4 business days for international shipments

### "In Transit" with No Updates

This status means:
- Your package is actively moving through the shipping network
- It may not receive another scan until it reaches a major sorting facility
- This is especially common for ground shipping methods

## International Shipping Tracking Gaps

For international orders:
- Tracking may stop updating once the package leaves the origin country
- It may not update again until it clears customs at the destination
- This gap can last 3-10 days depending on the countries involved
- Some countries have limited tracking capabilities after the package arrives

## Carrier-Specific Tracking Information

### USPS
- Typically scans packages at pickup and major distribution centers
- May show fewer scans for international shipments after leaving the US
- "In Transit to Next Facility" may appear for several days without changes

### FedEx
- Usually provides more detailed tracking with frequent updates
- "Picked Up" status means the package is in FedEx's possession
- International tracking is generally more comprehensive

### DHL
- Provides detailed international tracking
- "Shipment information received" means the label is created but not yet picked up
- Updates at each major checkpoint in the international journey
