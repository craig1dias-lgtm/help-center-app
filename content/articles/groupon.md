3. Verify if shipping costs are separate from the voucher value

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use multiple Groupon vouchers on one order?
No, only one Groupon voucher can be applied per order.

### Does my voucher cover shipping costs?
Most vouchers cover the product cost only. Standard shipping charges will apply unless specifically stated in the Groupon offer.

### What if I want to order more than what my voucher covers?
You can add additional items to your cart, and the voucher will apply its value to the eligible items. You'll pay the difference for any additional items.

### Can I get a refund on my Groupon voucher?
Refund policies are determined by Groupon. Please contact Groupon customer service for refund requests on unused vouchers.

### What happens if my order costs less than my voucher value?
Any unused portion of the voucher value will be forfeited. We recommend maximizing your voucher by ordering items that match or exceed the voucher value.

### Can I combine my Groupon voucher with other promotions?
No, Groupon vouchers cannot be combined with other promotional offers, discount codes, or sales.
