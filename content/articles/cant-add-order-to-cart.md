# Troubleshooting: Unable to Add Items to Cart

If you're experiencing issues adding items to your cart on the MatchMint website, don't worry! This is a common issue that can usually be resolved with a few simple troubleshooting steps.

## Common Reasons for Cart Issues

Several factors can prevent items from being added to your cart:

1. **Required fields not completed**: Missing information in customization fields
2. **Image issues**: Problems with uploaded images
3. **Browser cache/cookies**: Outdated or corrupted browser data
4. **Device compatibility**: Issues specific to certain devices or browsers
5. **Temporary website glitches**: Server-side issues that may affect cart functionality

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### 1. Check Required Fields

Make sure you've completed all required fields:

- **Name**: Must be filled in
- **Number**: Must be a valid number
- **Position**: Must be selected from the dropdown
- **Image**: Must be successfully uploaded
- **Card type**: Must be selected

If any required field is missing, the "Add to Cart" button may appear to do nothing when clicked.

### 2. Verify Your Image Upload

Image issues are a common cause of cart problems:

- **Check image format**: We accept JPG, PNG, and GIF formats
- **Check image size**: Files should be under 10MB
- **Check dimensions**: Images should be at least 500px in height/width
- **Try a different image**: If one image doesn't work, try uploading a different one

### 3. Clear Browser Cache and Cookies

Outdated browser data can interfere with the cart functionality:

1. Open your browser settings
2. Find the option to clear browsing data
3. Select "Cookies" and "Cached images and files"
4. Clear the data
5. Refresh the MatchMint website and try again

### 4. Try a Different Browser

Some browsers may have compatibility issues:

- If using Chrome, try Firefox, Safari, or Edge
- Make sure your browser is updated to the latest version

### 5. Check Your Internet Connection

A stable internet connection is necessary:

- Try connecting to a different WiFi network
- Try using a mobile data connection instead of WiFi (or vice versa)
- Test your connection speed at [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/)

### 6. Disable Browser Extensions

Some extensions or add-ons can interfere with shopping carts:

- Temporarily disable all browser extensions
- Try adding to cart in incognito/private browsing mode

### 7. Try a Different Device

If possible, try accessing the website from:

- A different computer
- A tablet
- A mobile phone

## Device-Specific Solutions

### For Mobile Devices

If you're on a mobile device:

- Make sure you're using the latest version of your browser app
- Try rotating your device to landscape mode for better form visibility
