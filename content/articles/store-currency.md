## How We Determine Your Currency

When you visit our store, we automatically detect your location and display prices in the most appropriate currency based on:

1. Your IP address location
2. Your browser/device location settings
3. Your previous currency selection (if you've visited before)

## Changing Your Currency

1. Look for the currency selector in the footer of our website
2. Click on it to see available currency options
3. Select your preferred currency
4. The page will refresh with updated pricing

Your currency preference will be saved for future visits.

## Currency Conversion Options

When you shop in a currency different from your payment card's currency:

### Option 1: We Convert (Default)
- We display prices in your selected currency
- Your card is charged in that same currency
- Your card issuer may apply their own conversion rate and fees

### Option 2: Your Bank Converts
- You can choose to be charged in your card's native currency
- Select this option during checkout
- Your bank will handle the currency conversion

## Exchange Rates and Conversion

Our currency conversion uses:

- Real-time exchange rates from major financial institutions
- A small conversion margin (typically 2-3%) to account for exchange rate fluctuations
- Updates throughout the day to reflect current market rates

### Sample Conversion Rates

| From | To | Approximate Rate* |
|------|----|--------------------|
| GBP (£) | USD ($) | £1 = $1.25-1.30 |
| EUR (€) | USD ($) | €1 = $1.05-1.10 |
| USD ($) | CAD ($) | $1 USD = $1.30-1.35 CAD |
| GBP (£) | AUD ($) | £1 = $1.85-1.95 AUD |

*Rates are approximate and subject to change based on current market conditions.

## Important Notes About Currency

### Price Differences
Prices may not be exact currency equivalents due to:
- Local market conditions
- Regional taxes and duties
- Shipping costs to different regions
- Rounding to standard price points

### Refunds
- Refunds are always issued in the currency used for the original purchase
- Exchange rate fluctuations may affect the amount you receive back in your local currency
- Processing time for international refunds may be longer (5-10 business days)

### International Transaction Fees
Some banks charge additional fees for transactions in foreign currencies (typically 1-3% of the purchase amount). These fees are determined by your bank, not MatchMint.

## Tax and Duty Information

Prices displayed in your selected currency:

- **Include VAT/GST** for UK, EU, and Australian customers
- **Exclude sales tax** for US and Canadian customers (added at checkout based on shipping address)
- **Exclude import duties** that may be charged upon delivery to your country

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will my bank charge me extra fees for using a foreign currency?
Possibly. Many banks charge international transaction fees (typically 1-3%). Check with your bank for their specific policies.

### Why are prices different when converted to my local currency?
Prices in different currencies reflect local market conditions, taxes, and rounded price points, not just the exchange rate.

### Can I change the currency after placing an order?
No. Once an order is placed, the currency cannot be changed. You would need to cancel and place a new order.
